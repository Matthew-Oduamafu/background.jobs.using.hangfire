# Email Service with Hangfire (Background Jobs)

This project is an email service implementation that utilizes the Hangfire package for handling background jobs, such as sending emails asynchronously. It provides a scalable and reliable solution for sending emails in the background, ensuring smooth user experiences and improved performance.

## Features

- Hangfire integration: The project leverages the Hangfire package, a popular open-source library for handling background jobs in .NET applications.
- Asynchronous email sending: Emails are sent asynchronously in the background, freeing up the main application thread and improving overall performance.
- Job scheduling: Hangfire allows for flexible job scheduling, ensuring that emails are sent at specific times or on recurring intervals.
- Reliable and fault-tolerant: Hangfire provides robust mechanisms for job retries and handling failures, ensuring that no emails are lost in the process.
- Monitoring and management: Hangfire comes with a built-in dashboard that allows you to monitor and manage background jobs, providing visibility into the email sending process.
